Native bindings of common UI elements for Haxe.

## About

There's really not a good way to take advantage of the native powers of Haxe. This library hopes to solve that problem by providing Haxe bindings for common native elements.

## Status

This project is brand-new so expect bugs, errors, and missing content. Also it does nothing yet! Yet.
